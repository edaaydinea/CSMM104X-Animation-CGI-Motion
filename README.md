# CSMM104X-Animation-CGI-Motion
This repository includes the projects of the [CSMM104X - Animation and CGI Motion course](https://www.edx.org/course/animation-and-cgi-motion-2) offered by Columbia University.

**Project Topics**
- T1M1 - T1M2 - T1M3 : **Theme 01: Mass-spring Systems**, in which I implemented point masses, gravity, springs, dampers, time integrators(explicit Euler, symplectic Euler, linearized implicit Euler) 
- T2M1 - T2M2 - T2M3 : **Theme 02: Collision Handling**, in which I implemented detection against fixed obstacles (discs, half-planes, polygonal objects), response against fixed obstacles (using reflection with a coefficient of restitution, and penalty methods), advanced pairwise detection between polygonal objects, and broad-phase accelerations using spatial hashing and hierarchical bounding volumes.
- T3M1 - T3M2 : **Theme 03: Rigid bodies** , in which I implemented computations of center of mass and moment of intertia for polygonal objects, time integration for rigid bodies, and contact with fixed obstacles. 
- T4M1 : **Theme 04: Elastica** , in which I implemented  the constant strain finite element, a discrete bending force for polygonal objects, and plastic and viscous flow.
- T5M1 : **Theme 05: Fuilds** , in which I implemented a fast and stable fluid simulation including advection, convection, and viscosity, in an Eulerian framework.
